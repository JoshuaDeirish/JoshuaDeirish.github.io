									<h3 class="major">About My Projects</h3>
									<p>My software development journey began in 2015. At the time, my projects lacked the polish and sophistication that would capture anyone's attention. However, I was determined to continually improve my skills and vowed to surpass my previous projects with each new one. Whenever I made a mistake, I diligently took note of it and used the experience to better myself on the next project. As I gained more confidence, I began sharing my work on Github.</p>

									<p>Since then, I have taken on medium and large-scale projects, both as an independent developer and as part of a team. Regardless of the project, I always commit myself fully and motivate those around me to do the same.</p>

									<h3 class="major">All Projects</h3>
									<p>I take great pride in every project that I work on, whether it's something I have completed in the past or a current work-in-progress. My diverse skill set includes proficiency in Front-End and Back-End development, as well as Design. In fact, some of my projects incorporate all three areas. Please find a list of my completed and ongoing projects below.</p>
